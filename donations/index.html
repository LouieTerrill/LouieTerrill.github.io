<h1>My donations</h1>
<p>
  I'm interested in Effective Altruism and am planning to take the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">Giving What We Can pledge</a> when I graduate.
  Consequently, I'm currently aiming to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities.
  (Were you expecting to find me soliciting donations for myself instead?)
  Here's a (non-infllation-adjusted) summary of where my earnings have gone so far:
</p>

  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Year</th>
    <th>Earnings (£)</th>
    <th>Donations (£)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2016</td>
    <td>2,000</td>
    <td>Against Malaria Foundation: 50, GiveDirectly: 50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2017</td>
    <td>2,000</td>
    <td>TBC</td>
  </tr>
</table>
