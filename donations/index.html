<h1>My donations</h1>
<p>
  I'm interested in Effective Altruism and am planning to take the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">Giving What We Can pledge</a> when I graduate.
  Consequently, I'm currently aiming 10% of my income to the most effective charities.
  (Were you expecting to find me soliciting donations for myself instead?)
  Here's a (non-infllation-adjusted) summary of where my earnings have gone so far:

  |2016   |2,000   |Against Malaria Foundation: 50, GiveDirectly: 50   |
  |2017   |2,000   |TBC   |
