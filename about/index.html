<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  As the spelling of my name is a little uncommon, anyone with an internet connection can find out from the first page of results that:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9suftOAHGdU">I performed at the 2015 Big Science BAHFest in London, and am a student at Imperial College London</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/users/20576/louie-terrill">I am slightly active on Stack Exchange, am a fan of Ghost in the Shell, and have read some Charles Stross and Greg Egan</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://headcgs.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/a-record-year-at-colyton/">I previously lived in Exeter and was a student at Colyton Grammar School, where I achieved at least 5 A* at A-level. I was probably born between September 1996 and August 1997, and I'm studying for a Physics degree</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://necronomicon-providence.com/archives/2015-archives/games/">I attended the 2015 NecronomiCon and ran RPGs including Fate, Eclipse Phase, and Call of Cthulhu</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/effective-altruism">I am the current chair of the Imperial Effective Altruism society</a>
    </li>
</ul>
  My Facebook page will also reveal my friends there and a photo of my face.
  Anyone with a LinkedIn account will also be able to find that I'm a member of the 80,000 Hours group there.
  Further investigation, such as finding my Reddit account, is left as an exercise to the reader. 
  Let me know if you've discovered something I've missed, and I'll list your preferred pseudonym on this site.

<h1>About my blog</h1>
<p>
  I decided to make a blog because it seemed like a good way to share summaries of interesting conversations I'd had with friends, with the added advantage that I could go back and present my thoughts much more legibly. 
</p>
<p>
  The blog is also haunted by a spooky ghost occasionally. It's probably nothing to worry about.
