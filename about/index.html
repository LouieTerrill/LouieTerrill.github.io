<h1>About me</h1>

<h1>About my blog</h1>
I decided to make a blog because it seemed like a good way to share summaries of interesting conversations I'd had with friends, with the added advantage that I could go back and present my thoughts much more legibly. 

The blog is also haunted by a spooky ghost occasionally. It's probably nothing to worry about.
