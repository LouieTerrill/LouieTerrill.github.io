          <li>
            Summer 2017, 8 weeks: On this placement I produced proofs of concept for a variety of emerging technologies that were seen as valuable opportunities by my host organisation.
            These were developed in an Agile setting, and my rapid demonstrations of robotic process automation, semantic embedding, and social media analytics using machine learning were particularly well-received
          </li>
          <li>
            Summer 2016, 2 weeks at the Centre For Effective Altruism: I contacted a variety of other organisations with significant youth engagement to help develop a set of best practices for setting up student groups, researched which conferences would provide the best opportunities to promote the movement, and wrote up a short literature review on the relevance of Mohism to Effective Altruism
          </li>
          <li>
            Summer 2016, 8 weeks: I created and developed systems of ontologies in order to describe and analyse a real system automatically. 
            I also used a Python script to monitor the connection status of a GPS receiver over a serial port, and wrote a Matlab script to analyse a data set without having access to it myself.
            My work ethic and documentation were consistently praised over the placement.
